            <div class="answer">
                <p>Market efficiency refers to the degree to which asset prices reflect all available information. It is categorized into three forms:</p>

                    <li>**Strong Form Efficiency**: Prices reflect all information, both public and private. No one can consistently achieve excess returns.</li>

                <p>An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the process through which a private company offers its shares to the public for the first time. This process is significant for various reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Capital Generation**: Companies raise funds for expansion and projects.</li>
                    <li>**Public Profile**: Going public increases a company’s visibility and credibility.</li>
                    <li>**Liquidity**: IPOs provide liquidity to existing shareholders by allowing them to sell shares in the open market.</li>
                    <li>**Valuation**: An IPO helps establish a market valuation for the company.</li>
                    <li>**Employee Benefits**: Companies can offer stock options to employees, enhancing retention and motivation.</li>

                <p>Diversification is an investment strategy that involves spreading investments across various financial instruments, industries, and other categories to reduce risk.

                <ul>
                    <li>**Risk Reduction**: Losses in one area can be offset by gains in another.</li>
